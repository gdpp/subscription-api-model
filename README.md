# Subscriptions API

This API is a personal project built for learning purposes and showcase in my portfolio, focused on implementing JWT-based authentication, user and subscription management, and integrating modern tools like MongoDB, Upstash, and Arcjet in a Node.js backend environment.

The main goal is to dive deeper into essential backend concepts such as session handling, access control, secure RESTful API design, and leveraging serverless and edge-ready technologies to improve performance and security.

## Project Purpose
This project is not intended to be a production-ready solution, but rather a learning sandbox to experiment with modern integrations and best practices when building authenticated APIs. It's ideal for anyone looking to understand how to build and secure subscription-based endpoints from scratch.

## Technologies Used
-   Node.js – JavaScript runtime for building backend services.
-   Express.js – Minimalist framework for routing and controller logic.
-   MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing users and subscriptions.
-   JWT (JSON Web Tokens) – For token-based authentication.

## Core Features
User registration and login with JWT.
Authenticated and protected API endpoints.
Basic CRUD operations for subscriptions.
Access control based on user authentication state.
